    <p class="ms-md-5 mb-md-3 hog_para">Classic, cheap, irksome, magnificent. That's classic Hog cycle. At first glance, this deck doesn't seem like much. It can actually beat all of that. Why? This deck has the fastest cycle speed out of all the working decks out there, and you can easily out cycle your opponent's offensive cards with your counters</p>
